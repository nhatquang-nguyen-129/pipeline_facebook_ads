FACEBOOK MATERIALIZATION MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------
This module materializes the final layer for Facebook Ads by 
aggregating and transforming data sourced from staging tables 
produced during the raw data ingestion process.

It serves as the final transformation stage, consolidating daily 
performance and cost metrics into analytics-ready BigQuery tables 
optimized for reporting, dashboarding, and business analysis.

‚úîÔ∏è Dynamically identifies all available Facebook Ads staging tables  
‚úîÔ∏è Applies data transformation, standardization, and type enforcement  
‚úîÔ∏è Performs daily-level aggregation of campaign performance metrics  
‚úîÔ∏è Creates partitioned and clustered MART tables in Google BigQuery  
‚úîÔ∏è Ensures consistency and traceability across the data pipeline  

‚ö†Ô∏è This module is exclusively responsible for materialized layer  
construction*. It does not perform data ingestion, API fetching, 
or enrichment tasks.
